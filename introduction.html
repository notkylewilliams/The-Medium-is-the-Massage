  <p>The medium, or process, of our time electric technology
    is reshaping and restructuring patterns of
    social interdependence and every aspect of our
    personal life. It is forcing us to reconsider and reevaluate
    practically every thought, every action,
    and every institution formerly taken for granted.
    Everything is changing you, your family, your
    neighborhood, your education, your job, your government,
    your relation to "the others." And they're
    changing dramatically.</p>
  <p>Societies have always been shaped more by the
    nature of the media by which men communicate
    than by the content of the communication. The
    alphabet, for instance, is a technology that is absorbed
    by the very young child in a completely
    unconscious manner, by osmosis so to speak.
    Words and the meaning of words predispose the
    child to think and act automatically in certain ways.
    The alphabet and print technology fostered and
    encouraged a fragmenting process, a process of
    specialism and of detachment. Electric technology
    fosters and encourages unification and involvement.
    It is impossible to understand social and
    cultural changes without a knowledge of the workings
    of media.</p>
  <p>The older training of observation has become quite
    irrelevant in this new time, because it is based on
    psychological responses and concepts conditioned
    by the former technology mechanization.</p>
  <p>Innumerable confusions and a profound feeling
    of despair invariably emerge in periods of great
    technological and cultural transitions. Our "Age of
    30 million toy trucks were bought in the U.S. in 1966.
    Anxiety" is, in great part, the result of trying to
    do today's job with yesterday's tools with yesterday's
    concepts.</p>
  <p>Youth instinctively understands the present environment
    the electric drama. It lives mythically
    and in depth. This is the reason for the great
    alienation between generations. Wars, revolutions,
    civil uprisings are interfaces within the new environments
    created by electric informational media.</p>
