<p>How much do you make? Have you
ever contemplated suicide? Are you
now or have you ever been? Are you
aware of the fact? Electrical information devices
for universal, tyrannical womb to tomb
surveillance are causing a very
serious dilemma between our claim to
privacy and the community's need to
know. The older, traditional ideas of
private, isolated thoughts and actions
the patterns of mechanistic technologies
are very seriously threatened by
new methods of instantaneous electric
information retrieval, by the electrically
computerized dossier bank that one
big gossip column that is unforgiving,
unforgetful and from which there is no
redemption, no erasure of early "mistakes."
We have already reached a
point where remedial control, born out
of knowledge of media and their total
effects on all of us, must be exerted.
How shall the new environment be programmed
now that we have become so
involved with each other, now that all
of us have become the unwitting work
force for social change? What's that
buzzing?</p>
