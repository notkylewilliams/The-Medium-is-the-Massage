    <p>The idea of detention in a closed space as a form
  of human punitive corrective action seems to have
  come in very much in the thirteenth and fourteenth
  centuries—at the time perspective and pictorial
  space was developing in our Western world. The
  whole concept of enclosure as a means of constraint
  and as a means of classifying doesn't work
  as well in our electronic world. The new feeling
  that people have about guilt is not something that
  can be privately assigned to some individual, but
  is, rather, something shared by everybody, in some
  mysterious way. This feeling seems to be returning
  to our midst. In tribal societies we are told that
  it is a familiar reaction, when some hideous event
  occurs, for some people to say, "How horrible it
  must be to feel like that," instead of blaming somebody
  for having done something horrible. This feeling
  is an aspect of the new mass culture we are
  moving into—a world of total involvement in which
  everybody is so profoundly involved with everybody
  else and in which nobody can really imagine
  what private guilt can be anymore.<p>

      a global village...a simultaneous happening. We
      are back in acoustic space. We have begun again
      to structure the primordial feeling, the tribal emotions
      from which a few centuries of literacy
      divorced us.</h5>
