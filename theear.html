        <h1>The Ear</h1></div>
      <div class="two">The ear favors no particular "point of view." We
  are enveloped by sound. It forms a seamless web
  around us. We say, "Music shall fill the air." We
  never say, "Music shall fill a particular segment
  of the air."<</div>
      <div class="three">We hear sounds from everywhere, without ever
  having to focus. Sounds come from "above," from
  "below," from in "front" of us, from "behind" us,
  from our "right," from our "left." We can't shut out
  sound automatically. We simply are not equipped
  with earlids. Where a visual space is an organized
  continuum of a uniformed connected kind, the ear
  world is a world of simultaneous relationships.</div>
      <div class="four">Homer's "Iliad" was the cultural encyclopedia of
  pre-literate Greece, the didactic vehicle that provided
  men with guidance for the management of
  their spiritual, ethical, and social lives. All the persuasive
  skills of the poetic and the dramatic idiom
  were marshaled to insure the faithful transmission
  of the tradition from generation to generation.</div>
      <div class="five">These Bardic songs were rhythmically organized
  with great formal mastery into metrical patterns
  which insured that everyone was psychologically
  attuned to memorization and to easy recall. There
  was no ear illiteracy in pre-literate Greece.</div>
      <div class="six">In the "Republic," Plato vigorously attacked the oral,
  poetized form as a vehicle for communicating
  knowledge. He pleaded for a more precise method
  of communication and classification ("The Ideas"),
  one which would favor the investigation of facts,
  principles of reality, human nature, and conduct.
  What the Greeks meant by "poetry" was radically
  different from what we mean by poetry. Their
  "poetic" expression was a product of a collective
  psyche and mind. The mimetic form, a technique that
  exploited rhythm, meter, and music, achieved
  the desired psychological response in the listener.
  Listeners could memorize with greater ease what
  was sung than what was said. Plato attacked this
  method because it discouraged disputation and
  argument. It was in his opinion the chief obstacle
  to abstract, speculative reasoning—he called it "a
  poison, and an enemy of the people."</div>

    <h5>"The discovery of the alphabet will create forgetfulness
in the learners' souls, because they will not
use their memories; they will trust to the external
written characters and not remember of themselves
... You give your disciples not truth but only
the semblance of truth; they will be heroes of many
things, and will have learned nothing; they will
appear to be omniscient and will generally know
nothing."</h5>
