  <h3>The new electroic interdependence
  recreates the World

    <p>We have now become aware of the possibility of
arranging the entire human environment as a work
of art, as a teaching machine designed to maximize
perception and to make everyday learning a process
of discovery. Application of this knowledge
would be the equivalent of a thermostat controlling
room temperature. It would seem only reasonable
to extend such controls to all the sensory thresholds
of our being. We have no reason to be grateful
to those who juggle these thresholds in the
name of haphazard innovation.</p>
  <p>An astronomer looking through a 200-inch telescope
exclaimed that it was going to rain. His
assistant asked, "How can you tell?" "Because
my corns hurt."</p>
  <p>Environments are not passive wrappings, but are,
rather, active processes which are invisible. The
groundrules, pervasive structure, and over-all patterns
of environments elude easy perception. Antienvironments,
or countersituations made by artists,
provide means of direct attention and enable us
to see and understand more clearly. The interplay
between the old and the new environments creates
many problems and confusions. The main
obstacle to a clear understanding of the effects of
the new media is our deeply embedded habit of
regarding all phenomena from a fixed point of
view. We speak, for instance, of "gaining perspective."
This psychological process derives unconsciously
from print technology.</p>
  <p>Print technology created the public. Electric technology
created the mass. The public consists of
separate individuals walking around with separate,
fixed points of view. The new technology demands
69
that we abandon the luxury of this posture, this
fragmentary outlook.</p>
